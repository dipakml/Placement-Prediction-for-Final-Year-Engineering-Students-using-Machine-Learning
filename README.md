### Overview 
Engineering placement, also known as campus recruitment, is when companies come to your colleges campus, conduct interviews, and hire candidates to work in their company. These campus placements are arranged for by your college who invite all the best possible companies to recruit from their students. The campus placements are held before the final examination. These placements not only benefit the students, but they also benefit the companies and colleges.
However, as a student, you need to prepare well for the campus placements. Getting the best companies for the placement drive is the main job of your college.
The main objective of the campus placement activity is to get students a job right after they have finished their education. Since the campus placement is conducted before the final exam, students have an added incentive to do well in their final exam. Students are also under less pressure. Good placements also allow colleges to claim 100% placement which is an excellent form of advertising for them. Companies get to snatch up talented people who will do some great work for their business.


In this project, let's apply machine learning techniques and develop a web based application to predict if the student will get place or not.


### Dataset Information





Dataset used in this project can be found here : [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/engineering-placements-prediction datasetId=1565495&sortBy=voteCount)


### Motivation
The motivation was to use machine learning experiments to predict whether sudent will get placed in campus placement.

Idea is to implement the end to end machine learning project while using free deployment platform like Heroku.

### Steps in the project execution

- Data gathering 
- Descriptive Analysis 
- Data Visualizations 
- Data Preprocessing 
- Data Modelling 
- Model Evaluation 
- Model Deployment 

### Technical Aspect 

- Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. 
- Building and hosting a streamlit web app on Heroku. 
- A user has to input key features.
- Once it gets all the fields information , the prediction is displayed.

### Installation 
- Clone this repository and unzip it.
- After downloading, cd into the working directory.
- Begin a new virtual environment with Python 3 and activate it.
- Install the required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt
- Execute the command: streamlit run app.py


### Note:
- Webapp can handle concurrency upto some extent but can be scaled.
